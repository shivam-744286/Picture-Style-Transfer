These lines import libraries that are needed for:

->TensorFlow: to use deep learning models.

->TensorFlow Hub: to load pre-trained models.

->NumPy: for numerical operations.

->PIL.Image: for working with image files.

->Matplotlib: to display images.

Afterr This; is the core operation:

-> The hub_model takes the content and style images as input.

-> tf.constant(...) converts the images into TensorFlow-compatible format.

The output is the stylized image â€” a combination of both.

IN OVERVIEW

This code:

->Loads two images (content and style),

->Uses a pre-trained AI model to transfer style,

->And then displays the new stylized image.
